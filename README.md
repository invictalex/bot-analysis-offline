# bot-analysis-offline

"Bot analysis" is a tool that 
    a) calculates the performance of i-tech's in-house crypto trading bots
    b) visually charts bot transactions & performance

## v1.0

v1.0 provides data charting and profit metrics (in GBP) for SpikeFish Bot #25.

## Aims for future versions

The next version will display profit performance as an ROI percentage rather than a GBP value. This will mean the tool can be used to analyse bots that are not trading in fiat.

In future versions the tool will also have the option to select between various bots to display.
